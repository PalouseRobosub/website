# About Us

WSU's Palouse RoboSub club develops underwater submarines designed to participate in the intercollegiate RoboSub national competitions. Located in the basement of Dana Hall, Palouse RoboSub combines Electrical, Mechanical, and Computer Engineering to create complex AUVs and ROVs.


## So what is RoboSub?

RoboSub is an international competition sponsored by [RoboNation](https://robonation.org/). In it, top universities from around the world build a fully autonomous submarine and compete every August in Irvine, California. The submarines have 15 minutes to autonomously complete tasks such as shooting torpedos, doing acrobatics, picking and placing objects, and much more. In addition to the 15 minute pool time, teams are also judged on their design decisions and engineering skills.

## About our Subs

### Guppie (2026)
Guppie is our top-of-the-line new and exciting project for RoboSub 2026. It features a double-hulled, 8 motor design with full 6-DOF motion. As we develop code, assemble PCBs, and manufacture parts, we'll update you with more information soon!

### Leviathan (~2027)
Leviathan (or Levi for short), is a proposed sub for RoboSub 2027 which will work in tandem with Guppie.

### Cobalt (Old!)
Cobalt was an old submarine from previous years that is now partially disassembled. We are working on aggregating Cobalt's documentation and publishing it here for posterity.

## About our Team

Our team is comprised of roughly 40 engineering students from WSU Pullman, with majors including (but not limited to!) Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Civel Engineering, Computer Engineering, Cybersecurity, and much much more.

We are always happy to take new members, so if it sounds interesting, consider [joining the club](/join)!
