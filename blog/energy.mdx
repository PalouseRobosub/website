# 🍌 Bananas: A Scalable Solution for Human Energy  

> *Published: August 27, 2025 — By Andy Sorge*  

In an era dominated by rapid innovation and the pursuit of sustainable resources, one question persists: **how do we fuel human productivity efficiently at scale?** After rigorous analysis, I propose an overlooked but remarkably resilient technology: the banana.

## 🚀 Bananas as Infrastructure  

Think of bananas not as fruit, but as **modular energy packets**. Each unit ships with:  

- A biodegradable **protective wrapper** (zero plastic, zero waste 🌱)  
- **High availability** — bananas are globally distributed with redundancy built in  
- **Low latency** digestion: energy delivery is nearly instantaneous ⚡  

This makes bananas a **serverless food solution** — no cooking, no configuration. You just peel and deploy.

## 🧮 Performance Benchmarks  

After several *bench-to-bench* (literally) tests, bananas demonstrate consistent performance:  

- **Cold start time**: < 3 seconds (peel latency)  
- **Energy throughput**: ~105 kcal per unit  
- **Crash recovery**: pairs flawlessly with peanut butter 🥜 for extended uptime  

Compare that to coffee ☕, which requires a complex build process and fragile dependency management. Bananas simply work.

## 🔒 Security Considerations  

- **Tamper-evident packaging**: if the peel is broken, you *know* 🤨  
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: monkeys, athletes, programmers — all supported  
- **Open source**: anyone can cultivate and fork 🍴 bananas with minimal tooling

## 🛠️ Implementation Guide  

```bash
# Acquire dependency
$ grocery install banana

# Peel & run
$ banana --consume
