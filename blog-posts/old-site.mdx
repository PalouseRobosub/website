# We have a new Website!

RoboSub is transitioning to a new website platform [hosted on GitHub Pages](https://github.com/palouserobosub/website).

The old content from the previous website is still accessible via (robosub-old.eecs.wsu.edu)[http://robosub-old.eecs.wsu.edu].

We will be transferring over old blog posts and documentation shortly.

Keep in mind that if you try and access the robosub-old website, you may get a security warning. This is normal, and you can continue by clicking advanced.
