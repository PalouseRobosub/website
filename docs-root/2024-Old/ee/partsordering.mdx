=====How to Order Parts=====

All of our parts get ordered through Quartzy. Quartzy is an inventory software that keeps all of our orders in one location. Please ask us to get you an account if you don't have one yet.


For normal parts (i.e. stuff of Amazon), make sure you have the URL of the page for it and possibly the part number. Please enter the exact price listed on the page.

For OSHPark orders, once you have uploaded your documents to the OSHPark website, go to your projects, and share the project. Get a permalink for the project and use it to when submitting your order on Quartzy.
