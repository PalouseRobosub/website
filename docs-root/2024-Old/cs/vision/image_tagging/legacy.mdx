=== Sloth and Darknet ===

Since we use Darknet, there are special configurations needed. After having cloned the [[https://github.com/PalouseRobosub/vision_dev|vision_dev]] repository, add the following line to your .bashrc, replacing the dummy path with the path to the vision_dev/sloth directory so that sloth can create darknet files.

  export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/vision_dev/sloth:$PYTHONPATH

----

=== Using sloth output with Darknet ===
When attempting to use tagged images with darknet, the annotation file will need to be in the correct format. To convert to this format, use the following command

  sloth convert <original file> <new_filename>.darknet

This will ask sloth to convert an annotation file in one format to the correct *.darknet format.

Once the file is in this format, you will need to run the `sloth_to_darknet.py` script which will generate the multiple files darknet requires based upon the compact information in the *.darknet file.

The following is an example command to generate said files.

  ./sloth_to_darknet.py -f /path/to/label/file -o /path/to/annotation/dir/ (optional)[-t training_list_filename.txt]

=== Getting Data to Label ===

We use the download_data.sh and download_data_current.sh scripts from the [[https://github.com/PalouseRobosub/vision_dev|vision_dev]] repository to get data from the server. Make sure that you always do a git pull before getting new data because the scripts change frequently.

First claim one or more batches to label from the current spreadsheet of data. The current spreadsheet is located [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j1Be_AjXxf2mgat3-XOz6fC_jkZvzBypRoEFcbkvcxA/edit?usp=sharing|here]]. Note which numbers you want.

Once you have claimed some batches run the following command in vision_dev to download and extract the data:

  ./download_data.sh bag_prefix_0 ## ## ##

For example if you want batch numbers 00 04 and 12 of the path_marker batch you would run:

  ./download_data.sh path_marker_0 00 04 12

Before downloading the data it will ask you for a username and password, please ask in either the it or general channels on [[https://palouserobosub.slack.com|slack]]
