====== Dynamic DNS Server Setup ======
<WRAP important>
This should only be done on one device on the network!
</WRAP>

Need to use dnsmasq to act as DHCP/DNS server:

Right now the sub computer acts as the DNS server, should make router do this.

{{ :cs:ddns:dnsmasq_settings.zip | current dnsmasq settings}}

Also important is to set a static IP in /etc/network/interfaces file:

<code text>
auto lo etho
iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet static
     address 192.168.0.7
     netmask 255.255.255.0
     gateway 192.168.0.1
