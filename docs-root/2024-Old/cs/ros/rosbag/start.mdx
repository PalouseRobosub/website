====== Using ROS Bag ======

ROS bag is a nice tool for recording any data that you need to be able to play back at a later time.

==== Recording ====

The normal usage is:

  rosbag record <TOPIC1> ... <TOPIC(N)>
  
If you want to output to a file with a timestamp and specific prefix:
  
  rosbag record -o <PREFIX> <TOPIC1> ... <TOPIC(N)>
  
In general we use this format for recording bag files:
  
  rosbag record -a -o <PREFIX>
  
==== Playback ====

The normal usage is:

  rosbag play <BAG_FILE1> ... <BAG_FILE(N)>
  
To play back a specific topic from the bag file:

  rosbag play --topics <TOPIC1> ... <TOPIC(N)> <BAG_FILE1> ... <BAG_FILE(N)>
  
==== Info ====

To see information about a bag file, rosbag info can help.

  rosbag info <BAG_FILE1> ... <BAG_FILE(N)>
