====== Writing Tests ======
ROS has a framework for running tests, called rostest.

===== Setting Stuff Up =====
The pieces needed for a test is:
  - the node to test (also known as UUT or Unit Under Test)
  - a file with tests (also known as the test or testbench)
  - a .test file that launches the UUT and testbench

Example CMakeLists.txt entry:
  add_rostest_gtest(test_serial_subscriber                                        
    serial_subscriber.test                                                        
    test_serial_subscriber.cpp)                                                   
  add_dependencies(test_serial_subscriber serial_subscriber_example)              
  target_link_libraries(test_serial_subscriber serial test_tools ${catkin_LIBRARIES} ${GTEST_LIBRARIES})

===== Compiling and Running =====
To compile all tests:
  rsmake tests

To run all tests:
  rsmake run_tests
  
To run a single test:
  rostest robosub <test>
