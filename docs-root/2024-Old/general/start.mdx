==== Slack ====
Slack is a messaging app that's designed for teams. We try to use it as our primary communication method for robosub-related matters. You can access it here: [[slack>|Slack]]. If you have a WSU email account you can sign up directly, otherwise you need to contact a club leader to get access.

We have a variety of different channels within Slack to organize our communication. By default, you'll only be a part of the general channel. You should at least join the channel for your team (software/electrical/mechanical), but feel free to join more!
