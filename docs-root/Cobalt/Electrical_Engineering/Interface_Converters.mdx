# Interface Converters

## Overview
Interface converters provide a means of communication from the main computer to peripheral microcontrollers. Interface converters are responsible for translating USB communications into UART, SPI, and any other serial communication protocol required.

## Serial Numbers
All Interface converters are custom configured with a unique serial number.
The serial number table is defined below
^ Serial Number ^ Device ^
