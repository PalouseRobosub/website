##### Charging Instructions

When charging the battery, make sure the settings match that of the battery. 
For the Tattu, it's a 16000 mAh, 4 Cell (4S), LiPo battery that charges at a maximum of 16 amps. We charge it at 8 amps, because it's easier on the battery and still charges the battery at a fast enough rate. 

Plug the battery sensing cable into the appropriate slot (4S for 4 cell).
