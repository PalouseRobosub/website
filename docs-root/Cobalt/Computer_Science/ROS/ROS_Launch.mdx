# Using ROS Launch

Normally this is used to start nodes based on a launch file.

Normal Usage:
  roslaunch /\<PACKAGE\> /\<LAUNCH_FILE\>
  
### Listing the Nodes Launched

This will list the nodes that a launch file will run on stdout.

  roslaunch /\<PACKAGE\> /\<LAUNCH_FILE\> --nodes
  
### Topic Remapping/Argument Replacement

This allows for changing the topic that a node publishes or subscribes to. This is really useful when using image_view. 

  roslaunch /\<PACKAGE\> /\<LAUNCH_FILE\> /\<ARG\>:=/\<NEW_VALUE\> /\<TOPIC\>:=/\<NEW_TOPIC\>
