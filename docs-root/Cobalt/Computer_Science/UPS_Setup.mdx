# UPS Setup

## Installing NUT for the OpenUPS

```bash
$ sudo aptitude install nut
```

Add the following to /etc/nut/ups.conf:

```
[openups]
    driver = usbhid-ups
    port = auto
    desc = "OpenUPS"
```
And comment out the line ''maxretry = 3''.

Try if it works:

```bash
$ sudo upsdrvctl start
```

Then, edit ''/etc/nut/nut.conf'' such that the last line reads

```
MODE=standalone
```

Finally reboot and run

```bash
$ sudo upsc openups@localhost
```

This should display information about the connected UPS. Check the ''device.model'' parameter and make sure that it is OPEN-UPS
