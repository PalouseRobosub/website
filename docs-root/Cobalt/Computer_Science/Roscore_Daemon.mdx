# Roscore Daemon
Some may find it convenient to have roscore automatically launched as a system service on startup. To do this:
  rosrun robot_upstart install --job roscore robosub/launch/roscore.launch
  
Once installed, you can use the normal service tools to manage the service:
  sudo service roscore status
  sudo service roscore start
  sudo service roscore restart
  sudo service roscore stop
  
To uninstall the service:
  rosrun robot_upstart uninstall roscore
