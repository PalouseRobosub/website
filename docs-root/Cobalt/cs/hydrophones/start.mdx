====== Hydrophones ======
Our hydrophones are a powerful tool for figuring out where we are in the water. Using 4 hydrophones, we can calculated our bearing to the pinger. For details, see [[cs:hydrophones:pinger_bearing:start|Pinger Bearing]].

==== Testing Procedure ====
==Materials:==
	* 1 tub of water
	* 1 pinger
	* Hydrophone Test Rig

==Test Rig:==
	* Pinger at one end of tub
	* Hydrophones at other end of tub
	* If lots of noise in readings observed, can place towels around tub

==Procedure:==
	- ssh into the sub
	- roslaunch robosub cobalt.launch
	- rosrun robosub pinger_bearing
	- rostopic echo /hydrophones/bearing
	- Manipulate hydrophones & Observe bearing readings
