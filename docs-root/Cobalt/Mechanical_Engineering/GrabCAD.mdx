### Introduction
GrabCAD is a PDM software that we use to store, share, edit CAD files for each years AUV. The goal of using this program is to eliminate any transferring of CAD files through USB and to have a central hub for all of our CAD files. This is so that each AUV made for Palouse Robosub can be archived and accessed at anytime for years to come. This page will provide you with instructions with how to sign up with GrabCAD as well as serve for the primary resource to troubleshoot any problems that you may come across while using GrabCAD.
