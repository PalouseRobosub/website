# Latex

Latex is supported in a minimal form for writing out equations in a more readable form. There are 2 main ways the equations will show up, inline and display. Due to the latex being sent to a remote server for rendering it may take a moment to load the results.

### Inline Math

Use dollar signs:

  $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
  
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ is inline with the text.

or escaped parentheses:

  \(1+2+\dots+n=\frac\{n(n+1)\}\{2\}\)

\(1+2+\dots+n=\frac\{n(n+1)\}\{2\}\) is also inline with the text.
  
### Display Math

To display math on its own line, use double dollar signs:

  $$ \frac\{d\}\{dx\}\left( \int_\{0\}^\{x\} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x) $$
  
$$ \frac\{d\}\{dx\}\left( \int_\{0\}^\{x\} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x) $$ is not inline with the text.

or escaped square brackets:

  \[ \sin A \cos B = \frac\{1\}\{2\}\left[ \sin(A-B)+\sin(A+B) \right] \]
  
\[ \sin A \cos B = \frac\{1\}\{2\}\left[ \sin(A-B)+\sin(A+B) \right] \] is also not inline with the text.
